# Anthropology

Anthropology, within theological studies, is the examination of humanity in relation to God, creation, and religious beliefs.

## Key Aspects of Anthropology in Theology

- **Human Nature**: It explores the nature of human beings, addressing their image of God, the effects of sin, and the potential for redemption.
- **Creation and Fall**: Anthropology examines biblical accounts of human origins and the theological implications of the Fall due to sin.
- **Imago Dei**: It considers how humans uniquely reflect divine attributes and responsibilities as the "image of God."
- **Sin and Redemption**: Anthropology investigates theological understandings of sin, its consequences, and the means of redemption through Jesus Christ.
- **Human Purpose and Destiny**: It explores questions about the purpose of human existence and the ultimate destiny of humanity, including themes of resurrection and eternal life.

## The Pre-Existence of Jesus
The identity of Jesus Christ is undoubtedly one of the most important subjects in the Bible (see John 8:24; 2 John 7). Our website will have other articles specifically dealing with the matters of Jesus' deity and humanity. This article will simply point out that according to the Scriptures, Jesus, or at least the person we think of as Jesus, existed prior to His coming in the flesh in the first century.

### Three examples in John's Gospel
In John chapter one we find these words spoken by John the Baptist:  
*“John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, 'This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me"'”* (1:15) and again, *“This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me"'”* (1:30). What is fascinating about these claims by John the Baptist is that, in the flesh, he was six months older than Jesus (see Luke 1:34-63).

We find a similar example with the words of Jesus Himself in John chapter eight:  
*“Very truly I tell you,' Jesus answered, 'before Abraham was born, I am!”’* (John 8:58). We could point out the very next verse where the Jews tried to stone Jesus for making this claim. This most certainly shows they understood His claims were that of deity; however, we will not go into this further and save those comments for another article. The point to emphasize here is simply that according to Jesus' own words, He existed prior the first century time period, when He was born of Mary.

The night before Jesus' death, He prayed to God the Father in John chapter seventeen. Notice what Jesus said in the prayer:  
*“And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began”* (John 17:5). Jesus clearly believed He existed prior to His days as a man in this passage, even as we saw back in John chapter eight.

### In the writings of Paul
It is actually rather difficult to point out the apostle Paul's belief in the preexistence of Jesus without getting into the subject matter of Christ's deity (e.g. Philippians and Colossians). However, there is one passage that sticks out quite obviously in first Corinthians. When Paul is warning the Christians of His day to learn from Israel’s mistakes that they made in the Old Testament, we find this verse:  
*“and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ”* (1 Cor 10:4). This shows us that Paul clearly believed Jesus to be alive and involved in the wilderness wandering stories from the book of Numbers. Israel experienced these wilderness wandering events more than a thousand years before Jesus was born in the first century.

### In the book of Jude
The apostle Paul is not the only one to point out the preexistence of Jesus in Israel's wilderness wanderings. Although not translated correctly in most of our English translations, there is a passage in Jude that connects Jesus with the time period of those events as well:  
*“Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe”* (Jude 5 ESV). While most translations read Lord rather than Jesus, notable Greek scholar Bruce Metzger notes concerning this passage the following phrases in support of Ἰησοῦς (Jesus): *“weighty attestation”* and *“which admittedly is the best attested reading among Greek.”*

## Conclusion
The identity of Jesus Christ is not something that is of little importance. As pointed out in John 8:24 and 2 John 7, it most certainly is the difference between being saved and being lost. In many areas of Scripture we may be unsure regarding the correct interpretation of a specific passage and may hold variant ideas than those around us concerning them. Understanding the nature of Jesus is undoubtedly a subject we must get right. Jesus Himself has not left us with any other choice. We hope that this article is a step in the right direction for us all in this ever-important doctrine of the faith.

# The Significance of the Nature of Jesus
**Written by Andrew Curle**

## The Significance of the Nature of Jesus
With sixty-six books to study within the Bible and what seems to be a never-ending amount of subjects and interpretations to think about, one may be inclined to ask the question, how important is it to understand who Jesus is? Here we can observe two Scriptures that show us how crucial this is:  
*“Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins”* (John 8:24).  
And,  
*“For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist”* (2 John 7).  

In John 8:24, Jesus says unless we believe He is “I am,” from the Greek *ego eimi*, we will die in our sins. To really understand the full force of this statement, think about two things: one, Jesus is claiming a person must believe that He is the One who spoke in Exodus 3:14 and Isaiah 43:10 (both show God referring to Himself as *ego eimi*) and two, the Jews understood this was His claim and is why they wanted Him to be killed (see John 8:58-59; Mat 26:62ff). Clearly a belief in the deity of Christ is essential to our salvation. Likewise, if one denies the humanity of Jesus, that person is a deceiver and against Christ, Second John verse seven informs us. This shows us why, conceptually, a belief in both the deity and humanity of Jesus matters.

At this point, you hopefully understand this. You may want to think a little deeper and ask yourself why these beliefs matter so much. Of course, we can certainly say that first and foremost the reason is because God’s word tells us this and God’s word is our ultimate standard of authority. Certainly, this would be the correct answer. Perhaps we can also show why this matters in a more practical sense. Here are three passages I would like for you to think about: Psalm 2:12; John 5:22-23; and Romans 1:21. In these Scriptures, we learn that if one does not worship the Son (Jesus), He will become angry; we learn that if we do not honor the Son, even as we honor the Father, then we are not really honoring the Father; and, even though one may know God, that is not enough if that person refuses to honor Him. Having a belief that Jesus is God is a salvation matter, and we must not only acknowledge Him as being God but treat Him as God as well by worshipping Him (e.g. through our prayers and songs).

# Studies in Greek

The study of **Greek** in the context of the Bible is essential for understanding the **New Testament**, which was primarily written in **Koine Greek**. Learning Greek helps in interpreting the original meanings, nuances, and cultural context of the Scriptures.

The Greek language provides **nuances** and **depths of meaning** that are sometimes lost in translation.

Learning **Greek grammar** and **syntax** aids in accurate interpretation and translation of biblical texts.

Many biblical scholars and theologians emphasize the importance of studying Greek for **biblical exegesis**.

# The Greek word παρουσία
**Written by Andrew Curle**

The Greek word **Parousia** is used twenty-four times in the New Testament. It is commonly translated as “coming.” This can be very misleading to many students of God’s word, because the word Parousia is a noun, not a verb. Typically when one thinks of the word “coming,” a person would think about someone or something moving from point A to point B. This is not the meaning of Parousia. Parousia means presence and/or arrival. In our English translations, you will find this word translated at times as presence, arrival, and coming. In YLT (Young’s Literal Translation) this word is always translated as presence. This can have significant effects on major doctrines, especially in the area of eschatology (study of last things). 

This can be shown by looking at a quote by New Testament scholar **N.T. Wright**:

> “The Greek word parousia does occur, in Matthew (24:3, 27, 37, 39; these are, surprisingly enough in view of its popularity among scholars, its only occurrences in the Gospels). But why should we think—except for reasons of ecclesiastical and scholarly tradition—that parousia means ‘the second coming,’ and/or the downward travel on a cloud of Jesus and/or the ‘son of man’? Parousia means ‘presence’ as opposed to apousia, ‘absence’; hence it denotes the ‘arrival’ of someone not at the moment present; and it is especially used in relation to the visit ‘of a royal or official personage.’ Until evidence for a different meaning is produced, this should be our starting-point.”

N.T. Wright goes on to say, “From this, the most natural meaning for the word as applied to Jesus would be something like ‘arrival on the scene, in the sense of ‘enthronement.’”

One can simply do a word search and see how this word refers to “where” a person is (e.g. 1 Cor 16:17; 2 Cor 7:6-7; 10:10; Phil 2:12). This changes everything when one examines all of the usages of this word when it is applied to Jesus. The Scriptures that so often give the impression to the reader that the saints will be with Jesus when He comes are actually referring to the saints being in His presence. 

For more on this significant point, see the articles in the **eschatology section**.

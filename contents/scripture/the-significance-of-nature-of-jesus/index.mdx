## The Significance of the Nature of Jesus
With sixty-six books to study within the Bible and what seems to be a never-ending amount of subjects and interpretations to think about, one may be inclined to ask the question, how important is it to understand who Jesus is? Here we can observe two Scriptures that show us how crucial this is:  
*“Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins”* (John 8:24).  
And,  
*“For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist”* (2 John 7).  

In John 8:24, Jesus says unless we believe He is “I am,” from the Greek *ego eimi*, we will die in our sins. To really understand the full force of this statement, think about two things: one, Jesus is claiming a person must believe that He is the One who spoke in Exodus 3:14 and Isaiah 43:10 (both show God referring to Himself as *ego eimi*) and two, the Jews understood this was His claim and is why they wanted Him to be killed (see John 8:58-59; Mat 26:62ff). Clearly a belief in the deity of Christ is essential to our salvation. Likewise, if one denies the humanity of Jesus, that person is a deceiver and against Christ, Second John verse seven informs us. This shows us why, conceptually, a belief in both the deity and humanity of Jesus matters.

At this point, you hopefully understand this. You may want to think a little deeper and ask yourself why these beliefs matter so much. Of course, we can certainly say that first and foremost the reason is because God’s word tells us this and God’s word is our ultimate standard of authority. Certainly, this would be the correct answer. Perhaps we can also show why this matters in a more practical sense. Here are three passages I would like for you to think about: Psalm 2:12; John 5:22-23; and Romans 1:21. In these Scriptures, we learn that if one does not worship the Son (Jesus), He will become angry; we learn that if we do not honor the Son, even as we honor the Father, then we are not really honoring the Father; and, even though one may know God, that is not enough if that person refuses to honor Him. Having a belief that Jesus is God is a salvation matter, and we must not only acknowledge Him as being God but treat Him as God as well by worshipping Him (e.g. through our prayers and songs).

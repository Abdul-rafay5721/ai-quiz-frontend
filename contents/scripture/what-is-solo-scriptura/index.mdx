# What is Solo Scriptura?

By *solo* we mean *(done by one person alone; unaccompanied)*. By *Scriptura* we are referring to *(the Scriptures)*. As a theological belief, this is the idea that a human being is capable of understanding God's word without any interference from the creeds and traditions of man. This is the main distinction between *solo* and *sola scriptura*. Notice how one article points out the distinction between the two:

> “If a group or person studies the Bible, and they think they have found some truth, doctrine, or practice in Scripture, then they should believe or practice this idea, whether or not it was ever believed or practiced previously in the history of the church. This is 'Solo' Scriptura. Sola Scriptura, on the other hand, as talked about by the Reformers, held to nothing of the sort. They believed that Scripture should be studied in conjunction with the rest of the community of the Saints, especially those Early Church Fathers who helped develop the Creeds of Nicaea and Chalcedon.”

Now, not everyone may agree with how that article depicts the two; however, that is the same distinction that is being observed by this author.

## What Scripture Teaches About Itself and Jesus

> **“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.”**  
> *(2 Tim 3:16-17)*

> **“Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.”**  
> *(John 17:17)*

> **“Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'”**  
> *(John 14:6)*

> **“Therefore Pilate said to Him, 'So You are a king?' Jesus answered, 'You say correctly that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”**  
> *(John 18:37)*

> **“That their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument. For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ. Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude. See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ. For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority.”**  
> *(Col 2:2-10)*

Many more passages could be listed, but these should suffice. From these, we learn that all Scripture comes from God. We learn that its purpose is to teach us, rebuke us, correct or improve us, and to train us. Scripture does these things so that we may be equipped or complete for every good work. This certainly includes, but is not limited to, spiritual matters. This is for every area of life, as we will present a case for in other articles.

Notice also from the passages given, we learn that Jesus and His word are truth. The apostle Paul tells us that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are *“in Christ.”* There is no truth, wisdom, or knowledge of any kind apart from the Lord Jesus Christ. Again, we will show why this is the case in other articles.

## Two Issues with Consulting Church Fathers or Other Writings

### 1. Theological Issue
God has informed us through His word that all truth, wisdom, and knowledge are found in Christ and His word. Consider this passage:

> **“But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.”**  
> *(John 16:13)*

Jesus told His apostles they would be led into all truth. This included not only their oral preaching but also their writings (see *Eph 3* and *2 Thes 2:15*). The reality of Jesus and the writings of His inspired men are all that is needed for a person or a group of people to realize the truth. You do not need any other writings for this—church fathers, reformers, or even this writer. 

One can look at these writings if one desires, but it is not required. Are we really expected to believe the inspired writings can only be interpreted in light of the uninspired church?

### 2. Logical Issue
If one is unable to understand or discover a teaching from Scripture contrary to what has already been put forward in the writings of uninspired men, then take your Bible and throw it away. You are wasting your time. There is nothing new that can be understood or discovered from God's word.

Ironically, those who claim Scripture must be interpreted in light of how the *“church”* has viewed the subject are often guilty themselves of going against their own claims (cf. the history of the reformation movement).

## Conclusion

On this site, we will always attempt to interpret Scripture with Scripture. Will this writer fail at times in doing this? Of course. No one is inspired today. Anything you read on here or anywhere else outside of God's word should never be thought of as authoritative.

Dogmatic positions will always be avoided on any area where Scripture does not give a definitive answer. Questions such as the role of language, memory, history, and science in their relation to *solo Scriptura* are addressed in the articles within the section *Defending Solo Scriptura*.

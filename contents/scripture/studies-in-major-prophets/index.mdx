# Studies in Major Prophets

The Major Prophets refer to a group of prominent Old Testament prophets whose books are longer and more extensive compared to the Minor Prophets. These prophets played significant roles in proclaiming God's messages, warning the people of Israel and Judah about impending judgment, calling for repentance, and offering hope for the future restoration.

These books contain prophecies, visions, and messages from God concerning the nations, the future, and the Messiah.

Each prophet has a unique style and message, but collectively they address themes of repentance, judgment, and hope.

Studying the Major Prophets provides insights into God's plan for Israel, the nations, and the fulfillment of His promises.

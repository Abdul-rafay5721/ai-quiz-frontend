# Ecclesiology

Ecclesiology is the theological study of the nature, structure, purpose, and functions of the Christian Church.

It explores topics such as the Church's origin, structure, purpose, sacraments, and ministry.

Ecclesiology addresses the Church's role in salvation, its relationship to society, and the importance of unity among believers. Understanding ecclesiology helps Christians discern the Church's mission and their role within it.

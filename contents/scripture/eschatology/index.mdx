# Eschatology

Eschatology is the theological study of the last things, focusing on the ultimate destiny of humanity and the world. It explores topics such as death, judgment, heaven, hell, the Second Coming of Christ, and the resurrection of the dead.

Understanding eschatology helps Christians anticipate and prepare for the fulfillment of God's plan for creation.

### An Exposition of 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18  
**By Andrew Curle**

#### 1 Thessalonians 4:13

> Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death (κοιμωμένων, present tense), so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.

Paul addresses concerns for the New Testament saints in Thessalonica. He reassures them about "those who are dead" during that time. The belief systems in the first century caused confusion and grief among believers, such as misconceptions about resurrection and the fate of those who died before Christ.

#### 1 Thessalonians 4:14

> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also the God will bring (ἄξει, future tense) with (σὺν) Him those who have fallen asleep (κοιμηθέντας, aorist tense) in (διὰ, preposition in the genitive) Jesus.

Paul assures that God will bring the dead to Him by means of Jesus. These references connect to the Old Testament saints and clarify misunderstandings.

#### 1 Thessalonians 4:15

> For this to you we say in the word of the Lord, that we who are living -- who do remain over to the presence of the Lord -- may not precede those asleep,—YLT.

Paul emphasizes the sequence of resurrection and reassures that the dead will be in God's presence first, destroying misconceptions held by some theological interpretations.

#### 1 Thessalonians 4:16

> For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with (ἐν) a shout, with (ἐν) the voice of the archangel and with (ἐν) the trumpet of God, and the dead in (ἐν) Christ will rise first.

Paul describes the Lord’s descent and clarifies that the dead will rise "with" Christ, emphasizing the continuity of their presence with Him.

---

#### 1 Thessalonians 4:17

> Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.

Paul discusses the timing and context of believers meeting Christ. The terms "clouds" and "air" symbolize God’s presence and the spiritual realm.

#### 1 Thessalonians 4:18

> Therefore encourage one another with these words.

Paul's teaching aims to comfort and strengthen the faith of first-century Christians.

### Three Reasons 2 Peter 3 is Not About the End of the World - Part One  

Second Peter 3:1-2 urges readers to recall the words of the Old Testament prophets. This passage is commonly misunderstood as predicting the end of the physical world. However, Peter uses language that aligns with Old Testament imagery rather than a literal destruction of creation.

#### Key Passage: 2 Peter 3:10-13  

> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat...

This passage uses symbolic language to describe significant changes in God's redemptive plan, not the destruction of physical creation. Interpreting Scripture with Scripture highlights the prophetic imagery.

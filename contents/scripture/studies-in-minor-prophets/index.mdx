# Studies in Minor Prophets

The Minor Prophets, also known as the Twelve Prophets, refer to a group of shorter prophetic books in the Old Testament that collectively convey God's messages to Israel and Judah. Despite their brevity, these prophetic writings contain powerful messages of judgment, repentance, and hope.

These books contain prophecies, warnings, and messages from God concerning sin, repentance, judgment, and restoration.

Each prophet has a unique message, often addressing social injustice, idolatry, and the covenant relationship between God and His people.
